=head1 NAME

makeblacklist.pl

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This script is used to generate the file sql/modules/BLACKLIST, which lists
all functions expected to exist in the database schema.  This file is is
used by tests to ensure that functions have not been overloaded (that there
are not multiple functions with the same name, but different parameters),
which our object mapper does not handle.

The list of functions is extracted from the sql module files listed in
C<sql/modules/LOADORDER>.

=head1 USAGE

To replace the current C</sql/modules/BLACKLIST> file with a new version,
run the following command from within the ledgersmb directory:

    perl -I lib -I old/lib utils/test/makeblacklist.pl --regenerate

Without the C<--regenerate> switch, output will be sent to stdout.

=head1 EXCLUSIONS

Two functions are explicity excluded from the output as they are known and
accepted to be overloaded, having one version that accepts an array parameter
and another which accepts a single value. They are:

=over

=item * in_tree

=item * lsmb__grant_perms

=back

=head1 OUTPUT

This script outputs a list of function names, one per line, sorted
alphabetically.

The file is intended for import into postgresql using the C<\copy> command
and therefore includes no header or comments.
